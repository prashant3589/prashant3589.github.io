Problem Statement

Currently, Azure DevOps YAML pipelines do not provide a native mechanism to validate ServiceNow Change Requests (CRs) as part of the deployment process. As a result, production deployments can proceed without verifying whether:

A valid Change Request exists in ServiceNow

The Change Request is active

The Change Request is approved and in an implementable state

This gap introduces several challenges:

Non-compliance with ITSM and change-management policies

Audit and governance risks, as deployments may occur without an approved CR

Manual validation, which is error-prone and difficult to enforce consistently

Lack of centralized control, especially when multiple pipelines deploy to production

Without an automated validation mechanism, enforcing ServiceNow change governance relies heavily on manual checks and process adherence rather than technical enforcement.

Solution Overview

To address this limitation, Azure DevOps Environments with ServiceNow Change Management integration are used to enforce pre-deployment validation of ServiceNow Change Requests.

Azure DevOps provides the capability to configure approvals and checks at the Environment level, which are executed before a deployment job is allowed to start. By integrating the ServiceNow Change Management extension, the pipeline can automatically validate the Change Request against ServiceNow using predefined criteria.
