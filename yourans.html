Hi Kamna,

Hope you are doing well.

We are reaching out from the Modernization Team. As part of the ongoing modernization program, we are implementing an integration between Azure DevOps and ServiceNow to validate Change Request status during the deployment pipeline execution.

For this integration, we require your support to create a dedicated service account in ServiceNow with the necessary permissions to:

Read Change Requests (e.g., change_request table)

Validate change status and approval state during pipeline execution

This service account will be used by Azure DevOps pipelines to securely query ServiceNow and enforce change-validation checks prior to production deployments.

Please let us know if you need any additional details from our side (use case, access scope, or technical information). We would really appreciate your support in enabling this integration.
