Jira Story Summary

Create Confluence documentation for Azure DevOps–ServiceNow Change Request validation using Environment approvals

Description

To ensure consistent adoption, maintainability, and audit readiness of the Azure DevOps and ServiceNow Change Request validation integration, comprehensive documentation needs to be created in Confluence.

This documentation will describe how Azure DevOps pipelines enforce ServiceNow Change Request (CR) validation using Environment approvals and checks, including:

Capturing Change Request number as user input during the approval step

Validating the Change Request against ServiceNow

Enforcing application-level validation using the OS Service / Application field

Supporting environment-specific validation rules, especially for Pre-Production deployments

The Confluence page will serve as a single source of truth for development teams, approvers, support teams, and auditors.

Acceptance Criteria
Documentation Scope & Content

 A Confluence page is created under the agreed space (e.g., DevOps / CI-CD Standards)
