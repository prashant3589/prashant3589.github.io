Jira Story Summary

Implement Azure DevOps pipeline to generate database migration scripts using Flyway

Description

Currently, database schema changes are created and managed manually, which leads to inconsistencies, lack of traceability, and increased risk during deployments.

This story aims to implement an Azure DevOps pipeline that uses Flyway to automatically generate database migration scripts in a standardized, version-controlled manner. The pipeline will ensure that all database changes follow a consistent naming convention, are validated before execution, and are stored in source control for audit and rollback purposes.

The pipeline will support generating Flyway-compliant migration scripts based on user input and environment configuration, without directly applying changes to the database.

Scope of Implementation

Use Flyway CLI to generate migration scripts

Enforce Flyway naming and versioning standards

Generate SQL migration files in a controlled repository location

Support environment-specific configuration

Validate migration structure before publishing scripts

Acceptance Criteria
Pipeline Execution

 Pipeline can be triggered manually or via commit

 Pipeline uses Flyway CLI (Community/Enterprise as applicable)

 Pipeline generates a new Flyway migration script without applying it to the database

 Generated scripts follow Flyway naming conventions

Example: V<version>__<description>.sql
