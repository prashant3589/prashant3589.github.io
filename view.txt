📌 Story Description

Design and implement an environment-wise Azure DevOps build pipeline for SSIS projects that can compile SSIS solutions and generate ISPAC packages for each target environment (Dev / QA / UAT / Prod).

The pipeline should:

Build SSIS projects using SSDT / MSBuild

Support environment-specific configuration through pipeline variables or variable groups

Generate ISPAC files deterministically

Publish the generated ISPAC files to Azure Artifacts with clear versioning and environment tagging

This pipeline will standardize SSIS builds, ensure traceability of artifacts across environments, and enable reliable downstream release/deployment pipelines.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline accepts an environment parameter (e.g., Dev, QA, UAT, Prod)

Environment selection controls:

Build variables

Configuration files (if applicable)

Artifact naming and versioning

Environment variables are managed via:

Azure DevOps Variable Groups, or

Pipeline parameters with secure variables for secrets
