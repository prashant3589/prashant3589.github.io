Design and implement an environment-wise SQL build pipeline using Flyway to validate, version, and package database schema changes for Dev / QA / UAT / Prod environments.

The pipeline should:

Use Flyway to perform SQL validation and dry-run migrations

Enforce versioned and repeatable migration standards

Support environment-specific configuration using pipeline parameters and variable groups

Generate a build-ready database artifact (validated migration scripts and Flyway metadata)

Ensure database changes are consistent, traceable, and deployment-ready for downstream release pipelines

This pipeline will provide a standardized, repeatable, and auditable process for managing database changes across environments.


✅ Acceptance Criteria
Environment Selection & Configuration

The pipeline:

Accepts an environment parameter (Dev / QA / UAT / Prod)

Loads environment-specific values such as:

Database connection placeholders

Schema names

Flyway configuration files

Uses Azure DevOps Variable Groups or secure variables for sensitive data

No hard-coded environment values exist in SQL scripts
