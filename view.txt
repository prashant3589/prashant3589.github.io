📌 Story Description

Create read-only replica databases for Database X and Database Y to support application and reporting workloads without impacting the primary databases.

The replicas should:

Be kept in sync with the primary databases using an approved replication mechanism

Follow organizational security and naming standards

Provide controlled access to a designated service account

Ensure no disruption to existing production workloads

This activity will improve scalability, reliability, and security by isolating read workloads from primary databases.

✅ Acceptance Criteria
Replica Creation

Read-only replicas are successfully created for:

Database X

Database Y

Replication method is implemented as per platform standards (e.g., Azure SQL Replica, Always On, transactional replication)

Replicas reflect data from the primary databases with acceptable replication latency

Replica databases are clearly named following standards
(Example: X_Replica, Y_Replica)

Data Consistency & Validation

Data consistency between primary and replica databases is verified

Sample tables and records are validated to confirm successful replication

Replicas are configured as read-only (no write access)

Service Account Access

A designated service account is granted access to:

Database X replica

Database Y replica

Access level is restricted to:

Read-only permissions (e.g., db_datareader)

No write, delete, or schema modification permissions are granted

Security & Compliance

Access follows the principle of least privilege

Credentials for the service account are securely managed

No elevated or admin-level access is granted on replica databases

Connectivity & Usage Validation

The service account:

Can successfully connect to both replica databases

Can execute SELECT queries

Cannot perform INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL operations

Application or reporting tools using the service account can read data without errors
