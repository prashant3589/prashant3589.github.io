Title

Implement Flyway Database Governance Framework (Quality Review, Drift Detection, Snapshot)

User Story
As a DevSecOps and Database Engineering team,
I want to integrate Flyway Quality Code Review, Drift Detection, and Snapshot generation into Azure DevOps pipelines,
so that database changes are governed, audited, and traceable across environments.

Business Value
Prevents poor-quality and insecure SQL migrations
Detects unauthorized manual database changes (schema drift)
Provides historical schema snapshots for audit, rollback, and debugging
Aligns database CI/CD with enterprise governance and compliance requirements
Scope / Description
This story will implement an automated Flyway governance framework including:
Quality Code Review (QCR) for migration scripts
Drift Detection Reports between database and Flyway migrations
Schema Snapshot Generation and Storage per release version
All features will be integrated into Azure DevOps pipelines running on self-hosted agents with Flyway Enterprise CLI.

Acceptance Criteria
Quality Code Review
Flyway QCR runs on every PR and pipeline execution
QCR reports generated in JSON and HTML format
Pipeline fails when critical violations exceed threshold
Reports published as pipeline artifacts
Drift Detection
Drift detection runs against DEV, TEST, and PROD environments
Drift reports generated using Flyway diff and diffText
Pipeline highlights schema drift without modifying database
Reports stored and accessible for audit
Snapshot Management
Flyway snapshot generated after successful migration
Snapshots stored in versioned structure (e.g., Versions/<version>/snapshot)
Snapshots retained according to retention policy
Snapshot comparison supported for debugging and audits

Enable ServiceNow–Azure DevOps Integration for Production (Service Account API Access & Validation)

User Story

As a DevSecOps engineer,
I want to enable production API access for the Azure DevOps service account in ServiceNow and validate the integration with the ServiceNow Production instance,
so that change request validation and automation workflows can run securely in production pipelines.

Business Value

Enables automated Change Request (CR) validation in production pipelines

Ensures compliance with ITSM and audit requirements

Eliminates manual CR verification steps

Supports controlled and auditable production deployments

Scope / Description

This story will cover:

Raising a ServiceNow Change Request to allow API access for the Azure DevOps service account in ServiceNow Production

Configuring ServiceNow roles, permissions, and API access for the service account

Updating Azure DevOps pipelines to use production ServiceNow API endpoints

Validating integration by performing test API calls and CR validation workflows

Documenting production readiness and operational procedures

Acceptance Criteria
ServiceNow Access Enablement

A Change Request is raised and approved to grant API access to the Azure DevOps service account in ServiceNow Production

Service account is assigned required ServiceNow roles (e.g., itil, rest_api, custom integration roles)

Network and firewall rules allow connectivity from Azure DevOps agent to ServiceNow Prod API

Integration Configuration

Azure DevOps pipeline updated to use ServiceNow Production API URL

Credentials stored securely (ADO Library / Key Vault)

Authentication method (Basic/OAuth) configured and tested

Validation

Test API call successfully retrieves Change Request data from ServiceNow Prod

Pipeline script validates CR state, schedule window, and business service mapping in Prod

Logs and evidence captured for audit purposes
