Jira Story Summary

Implement ServiceNow Change Request validation in Azure DevOps pipeline using Environment approvals for Production and Pre-Production deployments

Description

Azure DevOps pipelines currently allow deployments to proceed without automated validation of ServiceNow Change Requests (CRs), which creates a gap in enforcing ITSM change-management controls.

As part of this story, Azure DevOps Environment approvals and checks will be configured to integrate with ServiceNow Change Management, ensuring that deployments are validated against ServiceNow before execution.

Scope of Implementation

Production Environment

During the approval stage, the approver must provide a ServiceNow Change Request number.

The pipeline must validate the Change Request against ServiceNow to ensure:

The Change Request exists

The Change Request is active

The Change Request is approved

The OS Service / Application field in ServiceNow matches the deploying application

Pre-Production Environment

The pipeline must validate the Change Request against ServiceNow using a predefined set of allowed statuses (e.g., New, Assess, Authorized).

Approval should not require a fully approved change but must ensure the change is valid and relevant.

The validation must be enforced automatically and block deployments if criteria are not met.

This implementation ensures consistent enforcement of change-management policies and improves audit readiness across environments.

Acceptance Criteria
Production Validation

 Pipeline prompts the approver to enter a ServiceNow Change Request number during the Environment approval stage

 Pipeline validates the Change Request exists in ServiceNow

 Pipeline validates the Change Request is active

 Pipeline validates the Change Request is in an approved / implementable state

 Pipeline validates the OS Service / Application field in ServiceNow matches the target application

 Deployment proceeds only if all validations pass

 Deployment is blocked with a clear failure message if validation fails
