Active Directory Group Naming Standards for Azure DevOps Integration
Purpose
This document defines the naming conventions and usage guidelines for Active Directory (AD) groups used within Azure DevOps (ADO), specifically for:

- Environment approval workflows
- Role-based access control (RBAC) in ADO projects and organizations
Section 1: AD Groups for ADO Environment Approvals
Naming Standard
[Prefix]-[ProjectName]-[Environment]-Approvers
Examples
Use Case	AD Group Name
Production deployment approval for Project Phoenix	ADO-Phoenix-Prod-Approvers
UAT deployment approval for Project Nova	ADO-Nova-UAT-Approvers
Purpose
These groups are used to configure manual approval checks in Azure DevOps Environments, where only designated approvers (members of the AD group) can approve deployment workflows.
Guidelines
- Use a consistent prefix (e.g., ADO-) to distinguish ADO-related groups.
- Use Prod, UAT, Dev, etc., to clearly mark the environment.
- Avoid user-specific or team-specific names unless tied to the project.
- Keep group membership limited to users authorized to approve that environment.
Section 2: AD Groups for ADO Role Assignments
Naming Standard
[Prefix]-[ProjectName]-[RoleName]
Examples
Role	AD Group Name
Project Admins for Phoenix	ADO-Phoenix-Admins
Contributors for Nova	ADO-Nova-Contributors
Readers for Orion	ADO-Orion-Readers
Purpose
These groups are mapped to Azure DevOps roles to centrally manage permissions via Azure Active Directory, promoting RBAC best practices.
Guidelines
- RoleName must be one of: Admins, Contributors, Readers, Stakeholders, etc.
- Avoid assigning permissions directly to users â€” always use AD groups.
- Groups should be project-specific unless managing cross-project/global access (e.g., ADO-Global-Admins).
